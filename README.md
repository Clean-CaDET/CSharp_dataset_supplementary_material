# Supplementary material for the paper "Towards a systematic approach to manual annotation of code smells"

This repository contains the supplementary material for the paper "Towards a systematic approach to manual annotation of code smells":
* LC_LM_Heuristics.xlsx - documentation on processing the text extracted from the code smell literature into annotator guidelines. In the Sheet "Analyzed papers", we list all literature describing the code smells we collected to derive our initial annotation guidelines. In the second sheet, we analyze the number of relevant studies for each smell to select the smells investigated in enough empirical studies to derive the necessary smell detection heuristics. The third and fourth sheets present the coding results for Large Class and Long Method heuristics, respectively. Finally, the fifth sheet lists the paper we examined to derive our annotation procedure.
* Supplementary material.PDF - detailed discussions on certain points in the main paper. This document is divided into six sections, referred to in the appropriate segment of the main paper.

The main paper's preprint is available at https://www.techrxiv.org/articles/preprint/Towards_a_systematic_approach_to_manual_annotation_of_code_smells/14159183. The dataset presented in the paper is available at https://zenodo.org/record/6520056#.Y2O1wnbMKUk.
